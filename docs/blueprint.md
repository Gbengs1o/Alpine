- Background color: Light blue (#D8E2DC), a very desaturated tone of the primary, to create a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: Soft green (#94B49F) for call-to-actions and interactive elements, providing a sense of calm and efficiency.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a modern, clean, and accessible look in both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent services and highlight key information. Icons should complement the color palette and overall aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout to maintain a structured and balanced look. Ensure sufficient spacing and padding for readability and visual appeal.
- Use subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience and provide visual feedback. Animations should be smooth and unobtrusive.
